abstract: "The international trade literature has documented evidence of learning-by-exporting (LBE): that is, not only do more productive firms become exporters, but a firm's exporting activity and experience may actually increase its productivity. This paper considers a possible implication of this phenomenon: to what extent do productivity gains from exporting propagate through firms' supply chains? Furthermore, if engaging in international activity boosts productivity, then multinationals may also generate positive externalities to domestic firms. These spillovers, if they occur, would present a previously unexplored channel for gains from trade. I analyze the network of publicly listed firms in the US from 1976 to 1997."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
