abstract: " This paper examines the extent to which efficiency gains diffuse over a network of firms. Many empirical studies investigating firm-to-firm spillovers measure productivity by exploiting proxy variables or first-order conditions to estimate a production function. However, these methods implicitly rule out the interdependence of firms' outcomes and decisions through productivity spillovers. I show that ignoring network effects when estimating production functions may lead to substantial biases in both measured productivity and estimated spillovers. Furthermore, the direction of bias cannot generally be predicted *a priori*: depending on the structure of the network and persistence of productivity over time, estimates of network effects may be biased upwards or downwards. To address this limitation of existing methods, I develop a framework to jointly estimate network effects and productivity in value-added and gross output production functions. I demonstrate that my approach is robust to endogenous network formation and can accommodate network effects that are heterogeneous in direction and firm characteristics. Using this method, I characterize productivity spillovers over the US production network from 1977 to 2016 and find substantial heterogeneity by direction, industry, firm size and over time. My results suggest that, due to spillovers, the average firm in 1978 would be 17 percent more productive by 2016. In addition, a 10 percent increase in the productivity of the most central firm in each year would result in a 0.2 to 1.8 percent rise in aggregate TFP through spillovers alone."

summary: I document efficiency gains over the US production network from 1977-2016 using a novel procedure that jointly estimates productivity and spillovers.
